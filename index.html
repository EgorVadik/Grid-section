                            here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                            thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and
                            most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                            the course, I've successfully switched careers,

                            professionals who can help me learn programming step
                            by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                            about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
                            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
                            never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
                            team project, in particular, was outstanding. It

                            tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often
                            referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                            developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
                            job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                            multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
